# DSSBadgePlus
Revamp of UC Davis Campus Ready's Daily Symptom Survey, intended to be less prone to tampered survey results.

What is a **DSS**?

The Daily Symptom Survey (DSS) is a minute-long survey that promotes a mindful check-in on a person's symptoms and evaluates whether or not they are approved to access campus facilities. The survey combats the spread of both COVID-19 and the Flu, while also acting as a tracker to ensure students, staff, and faculty are compliant with the campus testing requirements.

What is **the issue** with the current DSS?

Many students, faculty, and staff are non-compliant with the campus testing requirements and have found many creative ways to create counterfeit survey results--also known as DSS badges. This work-around threatens the health of the community as asymptomatic individuals may be unknowingly spreading COVID-19 or the Flu.

**Why is** the spread of **COVID-19 worrisome** despite having access to masks and effective vaccinations?

Unfortunately, the authorized vaccinations have shown to wane in efficacy over time, especially as the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves and alters its structure. Any individual, healthy or at risk, is capable of developing long-term disease (commonly referred to as "Long COVID") that can have negative physical and mental health effects. The infection may also spread to vital parts of your body--especially the lungs.

**How** can the **current pandemic come to an end** in **our community** specifically?

Everyone must do their part in reducing the spread of COVID-19 by getting tested regularly, wearing highly effective masks (KN95, N95), completing the DSS, and quarantining when necessary. It is a **community effort**.
