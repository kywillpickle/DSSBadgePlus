# DSSBadgePlus
Revamp of UC Davis Campus Ready's Daily Symptom Survey, intended to be less prone to tampered survey results.

## Background
*What is a **DSS**?*

The Daily Symptom Survey (DSS) is a minute-long survey that promotes a mindful check-in on a person's symptoms and evaluates whether or not they are approved to access campus facilities. The survey combats the spread of both COVID-19 and the Flu, while also acting as a tracker to ensure students, staff, and faculty are compliant with the campus testing requirements.

***Why is** the spread of **COVID-19 worrisome** despite having access to masks and effective vaccinations?*

Unfortunately, the authorized vaccinations have shown to wane in efficacy over time, especially as the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves and alters its structure. Any individual, healthy or at risk, is capable of developing long-term disease (commonly referred to as "Long COVID") that can have negative physical and mental health effects. The infection may also spread to vital parts of your body--especially the lungs.

>***How** can the **current pandemic come to an end** in **our community** specifically?*

Everyone must do their part in reducing the spread of COVID-19 by getting tested regularly, wearing highly effective masks (KN95, N95), completing the DSS, and quarantining when necessary. It is a **community effort**.
## Inspiration
*What is **the issue** with the current DSS?*

Many students, faculty, and staff are non-compliant with the campus testing requirements and have found many creative ways to create counterfeit survey results--also known as DSS badges. This work-around threatens the health of the community as asymptomatic individuals may be unknowingly spreading COVID-19 or the Flu.

## What it does
This new DSS system uses DSS badges and adds in alternating seals to survey results for tracking results made on different days. Each day has a different badge seal set to ensure a person's survey was filled on that specific day.
This aims to prevent counterfeit DSS badges and symptomatic persons from entering Davis facilities.


## How we built it

## What's next for DSSBadge+
We hope that DSSBadge+ brings inspiration for improvements on the current daily symptom survey. It is strongly encouraged that these changes can be implemented to prevent further tampering of survey results and safer environments to the UC Davis community.
